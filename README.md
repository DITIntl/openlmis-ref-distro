This will hold the future Reference Distribution.  i.e. docker compose files to compose all services together for a OpenLMIS deployment.
This is a work in progress.

**Blue?**
> Regarding the open-lmis repo, the code name for the repository that will hold the OpenLMIS Reference Distribution is openlmis-blue.
> Why?  Blue as in water, water as it has surface tension, surface tension such as holding things loosely together, loosely held together
> as this is NOT "core"...  Most importantly it's a color and easy to remember, so until we can agree on the new repository name, it's
> openlmis-blue and fierce debate is encouraged.  (most of the previous sentence is meant to convey levity!)
