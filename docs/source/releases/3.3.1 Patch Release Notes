Changes to Existing Functionality
=================================

Version 3.3.1 contains changes that impact users of existing functionality. Please review these
changes which may require informing end-users and/or updating your customizations/extensions:

- `OLMIS-4728 <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-4728>`_: Requisition's properties can be overwritten when saved concurrently.


API Changes
===========

Some APIs have changes to their contracts and/or their request-response data structures. These
changes impact developers and systems integrating with OpenLMIS:

- Requisition service has a major release, v6.0.0, due to the redesign of emergency requisitions. See the Requisition changelog for details.
- Fulfillment service has a major release, v7.0.0, due to significant changes in the data model for orders, shipments and proofs of delivery. See the Fulfillment changelog for details.
- Reference data service has a major release, v10.0.0, due to changes for pagination, filtering and rights. See the Reference data changelog for details.
- Stock management service has a major release, v3.0.0, due to significant changes to stock events and physical inventory data. See the Stock management changelog for details.

Performance 
========================

No manual performance testing was conducted for this patch release.

Test Coverage
=============

Manual regression tests were conducted using a set of 30 Zephyr tests tracked in Jira. One bug was
found and resolved during testing. 
See the test cycle for all regression test case executions for this patch release: `3.3.1 Patch Release Test Plan and Execution
<https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/413991014/Patch+Release+Test+Plan+v3.3.1>`.

OpenLMIS 3.3.0 also includes a large set of automated tests. There are multiple types of tests,
including Unit Tests, Integration, Component, Contract and End-to-End. These tests exist in the API
services in Java as well as in the JavaScript UI web application. See the `Testing Guide
<http://docs.openlmis.org/en/latest/conventions/testing.html>`_.

For OpenLMIS 3.3.0, here are a few key statistics on automated tests:

- There are **2,665 unit tests** in the API services in Java, not including other types of tests
  nor tests in the Javascript UI application. `Sonar <http://sonar.openlmis.org/projects>`_ counts
  unit tests on each Java component.
- Test **coverage is over 60%** for all components, both Java and JavaScript, and is over 80% for
  many components. `Sonar <http://sonar.openlmis.org/projects>`_ tracks test coverage and fails
   quality gates if developers contribute new code with less than 80% coverage.

All of the automated tests, both Java and Javascript tests of all types, are passing as of the time
of the release. Any failing test would stop the build and block a release.

Further advances in automated testing are still on the horizon for future releases of OpenLMIS:

- Automated performance tests: There is already an automated test tool that measures the speed of
  API endpoints with a large set of performance test data. However, not all tests pass and there is
  not an established baseline for performance/speed of all areas of the system. Achieving this will
  greatly improve the objective means for tracking and improving performance.
- End-to-end testing: There is already an end-to-end testing toolset. However, coverage is very low.
  The addition of more end-to-end automated tests can reduce the manual test effort that is
  currently required for each release. It can help developers identify and fix regressions so the
  community can move towards a “continuous delivery” release process.

All Changes by Component
========================

Version 3.3.1 of the Reference Distribution contains updated versions of the components listed
below. The Reference Distribution bundles these component together using Docker to create a complete
OpenLMIS instance. Each component has its own own public GitHub repository (source code) and
DockerHub repository (release image). The Reference Distribution and components are versioned
independently; for details see `Versioning and Releasing
<http://docs.openlmis.org/en/latest/conventions/versioningReleasing.html>`_.

This service is intended to provide reporting functionality for other components to use. It is a

Assignment Configuration Errors report
(`OLMIS-2760 <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/browse/OLMIS-2760>`_).

Additional built-in reports in OpenLMIS 3.3.0 are still powered by their own services. In future
releases, they may be migrated to a new version of this centralized report service.

**Warning**: Developers should take note that the design of this service will be changing with
future releases. Developers and implementers are discouraged from using this 1.0.1 version to build
additional reports.
